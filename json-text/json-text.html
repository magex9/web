	<h2>The Problem</h2>
	
	<p>In many projects that I work on, data had moved to XML documents and many of them 
		are also transferring information as JSON as well.  When the objects were completely
		structured and all information were in their descrete fields this was an easy mapping
		between POJO's -> XML or JSON and all 3 are very interchangable.  However once you 
		start using more OO syntax such as HTML Domain Objects, things are not as simple.</p>
		
	<p>This example attemps to come up with a notation for transforming complex html pages and
		reports into strict JSON notation which show the semetatic information on the page
		which could be transformed into multiple number of outputs such as HTML, PDF, Plain Text
		Word, Excel among more.</p>
	
	<h2>Completely Structured XML</h2>
	
	<p>In many cases when xml is completely structured it is easy to move between XML and JSON 
	however</p>
	
<pre>
&lt;users&gt;
	&lt;user id="1"&gt;
		&lt;name&gt;Scott&lt;/name&gt;
		&lt;email&gt;scott@somewhere.com&lt;/emal&gt;
	&lt;/user&gt;
	&lt;user id="2"&gt;
		&lt;name&gt;Fiona&lt;/name&gt;
		&lt;email&gt;fiona@somewhere.com&lt;/email&gt;
	&lt;/user&gt;
&lt;/users&gt;
</pre>

<pre>
users = [{
	id: 1,
	name: 'Scott',
	email: 'scott@somewhere.com'
},{
	id: 2,
	name: 'Fiona',
	email: 'fiona@somewhere.com'
}]
</pre>

	<h2>Rich Text Format</h2>
	
	<p>However when this is applied to HTML, even when the standards are followed
		almost any element can exist inside of any other element a the same display level.
		The two main types are <em>block</em> and <em>inline</em> elements.</p>
		
	<p>Block level elements represented as JSON are fairly easy to map as the HTML tags
		are fairly structured and normally are different ways to layout and associated
		the inline elemensts.</p>
		
	<p>Inline elements however can take other inline elements as well as text and need 
		to preserve the order and spacing.  This is where things become difficult.  
		Take the following example:</p>
	
<pre>
&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;em&gt;important&lt;/em&gt; text.&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>

	<p>Wikis have solved this by having a simplified version of text that can be displayed
		on the page called markdown.  Putting astrix's around the important would
		make it show up as bold on a webpage.  However what if extra styling is required or
		two paragraphs should be place i two different spots.  The markdown simplification
		can handle these extra elements.</p>
		
<pre>
This is *important* text.
</pre>

	<p>An example json notation of the above could be the following where all the important elements
		are preserved such as are the spacing between the important text.</p>
		
<pre>
[{
	type: 'paragraph',
	type: 'block',
	items: [{
		type: 'text',
		items: ['This is important ']
	},{
		type: 'em',
		type: 'inline',
		items: [{
			type: 'text',
			items: ['important']
		}]
	},{
		type: 'text',
		items: [' text.']
	}]
}]
</pre>

	<p>This version of the json object is very verbose but easy for a framework to parse and create
		thier own view of the information.  However some of this information can be condensed down if 
		we know some of this will happen alot or could be derived.</p>
		
	<p>Since we can create a schema of all the element, and each one of them either an inline or block
		element, we can eliminate this from the configuration.  This will get rid of all of the 'type'
		attributes.  We can also turn all of the 'text' objects into just strings to keep things more
		readable.  If a basic string is place in a block level configuration element, it should be 
		concidered a paragraph.</p>
		
<pre>
[{
	type: 'paragraph',
	items: ['This is important ',{type: 'em', items: ['important']},' text.']
}]
</pre>

<section>
	<h2>Complex Section</h2>
	<p>This is an example of a complex section</p>
	<p>The test <em class="label label-success">Passed!</em>.</p>
	<p><a href="#">View the results</a>; 1 pass, 0 failures.</p>
</section>

<pre>
&lt;section&gt;
	&lt;h2&gt;Complex Section&lt;/h2&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;This is an example of a complex section&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The test &lt;em class="success"&gt;Passed!&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;View the results&lt;/a&gt;; 1 pass, 0 failures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
</pre>

<pre>
[{
	type: 'section',
	title: 'Complex Section',
	items: [{
		type: 'paragraph',
		items: ['This is an example of a complex section']
	},{
		type: 'paragraph',
		items: ['The test', {
			type: 'em',
			class: 'success',
			items: ['Passed!']
		},'.']
	},{
		type: 'paragraph',
		items: [{
			type: 'a',
			href: '#',
			items: ['View the results']
		},'; 1 pass, 0 failures.']
	}]
}]
